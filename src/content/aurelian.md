<!-- Description here. Not too much text plsz. -->
The collectiv alles-negativ was founded by Carlo Natter and Aurelian Ammon. They try to combine their multidisciplinary interests in design to explore projects from unexpected angles. The connections between the physical and the digital realms is intriguing to them and they try to find approaches to observe and test how the distinction between virtuality and reality is shifting towards each other.
