Edna likes interdisciplinary work and innovative approaches to design problems. She is interested in the hot spot of interpersonal interactions and experimental use of new technologies. To design for and with people is her goal while keeping sociocultural developments in mind.
Besides curiously exploring her surroundings, you can find her shooting analog stories, cooking dinner for friends and climbing beautiful rocks.
